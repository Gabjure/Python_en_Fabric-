# 🧱0️⃣ [Python in Fabric] LELI5: Fabric + Python = Easy Pipeline? (W4TT special)   
*If you hate pointless steps or endless instructions, this is your no-BS zone.*   
 --- 
> 🔤 What is Leli5?   

Leli5 = LEGO + ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5).   
**The recipe?** I explain tech and data as if they were LEGO:   
- Simple   
- Visual   
- Zero gatekeeping tech-speak   
   
Step by step, so you can play and learn at your own pace.   
If you see "Leli5" around here, it means: easy explanations, no gatekeeping, everyone builds.

## 🎯 Context: W4TT   
This series was born from my talk for W4TT (Women 4 Tech Talks), where [Mar Lizana](https://medium.com/u/c780a6cab72a) and I showed step by step how to use Python in Microsoft Fabric for a real data pipeline.   
Missed it? No stress:

## 🚀 INTRO: Why LEGO?   
Fabric, Python, Kaggle, Notebooks…?   
Sounds like engineering, but here's the thing: it's all like building with LEGOs. Ready-made pieces, flexible instructions, and the focus is on understanding the *why*, not just memorizing the *how*.   
Missing a piece? No biggie. Building, breaking, rebuilding—that's all part of learning.   
 --- 
## 🏗️ Fabric   
**Your complete LEGO set.** Everything pre-sorted, numbered, and ready to go. No hunting across 10 different boxes—just one unified environment.   
 --- 
## 🔧 Python   
**The architect's toolkit.** Pieces sorted by color and size, instructions on the side.   
The rule? **Build whatever you want—no limits.**   
 --- 
## 🏢 Kaggle   
**The LEGO store for data nerds.** This is where the world's datasets live.   
You can:   
- Browse epic builds from other creators   
- Grab datasets (aka your LEGO bricks)   
- Ask questions and get help from the community   
 --- 
   
## 🖥️ Environment   
**Your LEGO room.**   
Everything you need to build without distractions: pieces, blueprint, space for creative chaos.   
 --- 
## 📒 Notebooks   
**Your magic digital lab notebook.**   
Write, test, fix, see results—all in real time.   
No digging through 200-page manuals. No guessing. Just do.   
 --- 
## 🤗 What if you mess up?   
**Mistakes? That's just learning in disguise.**   
You can go back, try different approaches, mix and match pieces.   
We're all builders here, not critics.

## 🌟 Who is this for?   
- 🧑‍💻 Anyone migrating to Fabric   
- 🐣 Data beginners   
- 🐍 Python explorers ready for the next step   
- 🎒 Curious minds allergic to boring manuals? You're in the right place.
